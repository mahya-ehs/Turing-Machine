# Turing Machine
This is a  program for simulating Turing machine.

## Usage
Run the project in Intellij Idea or whatever IDE you're using for Java. Make sure you have JavaFx installed.

## How to use the program?
You have to enter the alphabet and states of the machine
and then the transition functions. 
Be careful that after every transition function, you have
to press the `Next` button ,but after the last 
transition function, you have to press the `Finish` button.

The program will also print the transition functions you typed
in the console for your convenience.

After that, you may be able to enter the input you want.
After starting the machine and watching the result,
you can put a new string by pressing the `New Input` button.
